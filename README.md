# CV-threat-detection
Past project where I worked with I Chieh and Wei Ming to train a RESNET model to classify images into 3 categories: Threat (Gun present and threatening) Carrying (Gun present and not threatening) and Normal (No Guns)

I am still in the midst of cleaning and transferring the code from my local computer, thank you for being patient!
